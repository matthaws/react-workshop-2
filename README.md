# React: Beyond the Basics - Part 2

App Academy Job Seeker Technical Workshop 5/11/18

In the last workshop, we covered more advanced features and design patterns in React development. We'll continue this exploration, getting into some much more complicated design patterns as well as some of the newest and shiniest features in recent React updates. We'll look at:

* Compound components

* The new Context API

* Render props

Along the way we may brush up against some new Javascript syntax or CSS properties that you may not yet have seen including:

* `display: contents`

* CSS Grid
